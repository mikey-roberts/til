# Check file changes since last commit

The git diff command can be used to compare changes to certain files to see what changes have been made since the last commit.

**example -** 

_Compares the changes across all files that have changed._
```
git diff
```

_To compare one particular file, use the `git diff` command, followed by the file location._
```
git diff /specific/file/in/question.rb
```
