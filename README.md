# Today I learned
This section of my Github is dedicated to documenting syntax, commands and tricks I have learned, across a range of technologies.<br>
Each TIL will be wirrten in MD and includes a concise how-to summary. 

# About
Thanks to a colleague for suggesting this as a useful tool to help keep track of what I learn. <br>
Additionally, credit to Thoughtbot's TIL - https://github.com/thoughtbot/til (It helped offer some inspiration in how to format the Repo by different technologies.)
